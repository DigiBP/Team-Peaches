# Excite new Applicants
## Gaining efficiency and enthusiasm by implementing transparency and AI in your hiring process

Crystal Applications is the project of four BIS master students the university of applied sciences and arts northwestern switzerland (FHNW) as part of the module Digitalization of Business Processes. 
The project aims to improve a classical recruitment process for a vacancy through digitalization, automation and innovation. The project covers the period from the moment when a internal staff application is approved until a shortlist of applicants for interviews is compiled.
The main goal of the project is to optimize the existing AS IS process so that digital technologies generate added value for the applicant as well as for the company - especially the HR department. The key elements are transparency, user-friendliness, low error rate, low effort and a better triage of the applicants for the shortlist.
Does it sound like a win-win solution? Yes, it does.
