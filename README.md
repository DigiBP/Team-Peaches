## ðŸ’  Crystal Application ðŸ’ 
Crystal Application is the project of four BIS master students @FHNW in connection with the module digitalization of business processes. 
The project focuses on the early stages of an application/ hiring process from the release of a job advertisement until the suitable candidates of a shortlist are invited for a first interview and the other candidates received a rejection. The main goal of the project is to generate advantages by digitization, automation, and innovation; both for the potential candidates and the hiring company/ organization as well. Does it sound like a win-win solution? Yes, it is.
