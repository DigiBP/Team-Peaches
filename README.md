# Crystal Application
Crystal Application is the project of four BIS master students @FHNW in connection with the module digitalization of business processes. 
The project focuses on the early stages of an application/ hiring process from the release of a job advertisement until the suitable candidates of a shortlist are invited for a first interview and the other candidates received a rejection. The main goal of the project is to generate advantages by digitization, automation, and innovation; both for the potential candidates and the hiring company/ organization as well. Does it sound like a win-win solution? Yes, it is.

## Use Case
Today in Switzerland, in a common situation of a hiring process, a candidate submits his or her application dossier based on the given information of the job advertisement. Depending on the clarity of the job advertisement, it is more or less assessable if the must-requirements are fulfilled or not. In addition, in most cases it is completely non-transparent, how the salary range would look like. This leads to an unclear situation for the candidates and not seldom to negative surprises later in the hiring process. On the other side, the hiring company or organization receives the application dossiers for the first review and filtering. But would all these candidates have submitted their dossier, if they had known their “candidate-position-fit” and even the salary range in advance? This situation leads to inefficiencies and to reduced motivation on both sides. Candidates prepare and submit dossiers they wouldn’t if the situation would have been clear regarding their position-fit and salary. Also, the companies are inefficient, because they receive and care about dossiers and even first interviews of candidates they wouldn’t have to if the candidates would have known the important information in advance.

## Purpose and Goal
The purpose of the project is to learn how to digitize business processes on the basis of a fictive praxis example. 
The project goal is to digitize and automate the early stages of an application process by an increased transparency in order to reduce waste and inefficiency for all involved stakeholders. In addition, the new digitized and at least partly automated process should increase the motivation of the process participants and enhance the employer branding of a company/ organization in mid- and long-term times by integrating helpful and not common innovations.

## Project Organization and Structure
The project is organized in an agile way with several sprints. With this approach the project team gains the flexibility regarding the end solution, which is not clear at the start and even during the project. The several sprints contain the subsequent described goal and content. One sprint takes 3 weeks in time.
