## ðŸ’  Crystal Application ðŸ’ 
Crystal Application is the project of four BIS master students the university of applied sciences and arts northwestern switzerland (FHNW) as part of the module Digitalization of Business Processes. 
The project aims to improve a classic recruitment process for a vacancy through digitization, automation and innovation. The focus lies on the period from the posting of the job advertisement to the moment when a shortlist of candidates for interviews is available and the remaining applicants have received a rejection.
The main goal of the project is to optimize the existing AS IS process so that digital technologies generate added value for the applicant as well as for the company - especially the HR department. The key elements are transparency, user-friendliness, low error rate, low effort and a better triage of the applicants for the shortlist.
Does it sound like a win-win solution? Yes, it does.
